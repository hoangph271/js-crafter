`JavaScript` to `Java` is as same as `car` to `carpet`

## What is JS

- *Weak* type:  
`int i; String name;` <- Java  
`var i; const name; let age;` <- JS  
`var` is pretty fucking old...!  
`const`, `let` is better, newer...!  
- *Dynamic* type:  
`let name = '@HHP'`  
`name = 12;`  
`name = true;`  
`name = {};`  
`name = null`  
- Is a *scripting* language  
Java -> .jar, .class  
C -> .exe, .sh  
JavaScript: Just .js  

## What is JS for...?  
- Was BORN frotend...!  
- Server, mobile, desktop, serverless...!
